# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
I have tried out coding very famous Tic Tac Toe game. 

-> It was fun implementing with basics of c++, and Object oriented programming. 

-> I have used pure virtual functions and Run time polymorphism which allows us to use the base pointer to access the members of the derived class.

-> Encapsulated pure abstract class, which is the blueprint for Tic Tac Toe.

-> I have thought that if we have multiple rooms, for this 2 player game in an online mode. We do not have to hard code for every room.
